### Lessons Learned in the Assignment:
1. (How to use an API, how they work and who uses/creates them and why (like how Amazon and Google and other big companies seem to be all over the web because so many people can utilize their APIs to include then on their sites for increased convenience and connection.)
2. (AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML) allows the program to gather data from the server without having to reload the page, which makes it faster and easier .)
3. (JSON is an extension of Javascript, and it primarily works to allow users to access public data through code from the site that transmits information from a public server to the application.)
